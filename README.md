1. Usage

This a web based file sharing server.

The script when is executed would ask you to whether to give upload permissions (y/n) on the server?

Then it would give the IP of your server as it's all web based. Like this:

Give uploading permissions (Y/N): n
=== ðŸŽ‰ HTTP File Sharing Server ===
[+] Server running at http://192.168.0.103:8000

Now it would make a folder named "shared_files" in the same directory as the script. Now you can place any file in the 
in the shared_files folder. You could also upload whole directories.

2. Inspiration

So I heard abt WinSCP and when I used to make writeups. I did wanna transfer files from my mobile to my PC. It was a pain in the ass.
So I made this. Now it's easy. XD. The name is also inspired from WinSCP cuz I was too lazy to name the script WINSCP. lol.
